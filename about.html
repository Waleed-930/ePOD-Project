      <h1>About the ePOD Project</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>Electronic Proof of Delivery (ePOD)</strong> system is a course project for
        <em>CPIS-358: Internet Application and Web Programming</em>.
        It simulates how companies can move from paper-based proof-of-delivery to a
        digital platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    <section id="mission"><!--this is the mission section h2 is the title of the section we put an unordered list and a paragraph and used strong to make sure the user reads it-->
      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Digitize and simplify the delivery confirmation process.</li>
        <li>Reduce paperwork and disputes between customers and sales teams.</li>
        <li>Improve tracking, accountability, and reporting of deliveries.</li>
        <li>Provide small dashboards that show POD completeness and pending signatures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this first version, the system is <strong>stand-alone</strong>. Orders are entered manually
        , and signed PODs are stored as digital records.
        Later, the concept can be extended to integrate with ERP systems such as SAP.
